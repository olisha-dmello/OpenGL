Athabasca University, COMP390 (Winter 2025)

- Designed and implemented an interactive 3D cityscape using C++ and OpenGL, featuring textured skyscrapers, dynamic colored lighting, atmospheric fog, and animation effects.
- Developed reusable composite 3D objects (trees, fountains, buildings) using transformation hierarchies and modular design principles.
- Integrated custom BMP texture loading and advanced lighting models (ambient, diffuse, specular) to enhance scene realism.
- Applied fog attenuation and light animation to simulate atmospheric depth and create a realistic night skyline effect.
